My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for 2020. So far they
are all written in Nim. To run them simply install [Nim](https://nim-lang.org)
and run `nim c -r partX.nim`. To use them on your own inputs replace the
`input.txt` files. Some days might have more than one solution which can then
be found in `partX_<name>.nim`.
